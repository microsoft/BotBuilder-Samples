# Custom Question Answering

This is the Bot Framework v4 Custom question answering bot sample, which shows how to use advanced features of [Cognitive Services question answering][LS], such as [Precise answering][PA], support for unstructured sources, [Multi-turn conversations][MT], and [Active Learning][AL] in a bot.

This bot was created using [Bot Framework][BF].

## Concepts introduced in this sample
[Question answering][LS] enables you to build, train, and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured and unstructured documents, or editorial content in minutes. In this sample, we demonstrate:
- How to use active learning to generate suggestions for your knowledge base.
- How to use follow-up prompts to create multiple turns of a conversation.
- How to configure display of precise answers.
- How to enable/disable querying unstructured sources with the bot.

## Prerequisites
- This project requires a [Language resource](https://aka.ms/create-language-resource) with Custom question answering enabled.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18 or higher

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

### Configure knowledge base of the project
- Follow instructions [here][Quickstart] to create a Custom question answering project. You will need this project's name to be used as `ProjectName` in [.env file](.env).
- Visit [Language Studio][LS] and open created project.
- Go to `Edit knowledge base` -> Click on `...` -> Click on `Import questions and answers` -> Click on `Import as TSV`.
- Import [SampleForCQA.tsv](CognitiveModels/SampleForCQA.tsv) file.
- You can test your knowledge base by clicking on `Test` option.
- Go to `Deploy knowledge base` and click on `Deploy`.

### Connect your bot to the project.
Follow these steps to update [.env file](.env).
- In the [Azure Portal][Azure], go to your resource.
- Go to `Keys and Endpoint` under Resource Management.
- Copy one of the keys as value of `LanguageEndpointKey` and Endpoint as value of `LanguageEndpointHostName` in [.env file](.env).
- `ProjectName` is the name of the project created in [Language Studio][LS].

## To try this sample

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.14.0 or greater from [here][BFE]
- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/48.customQABot-all-features`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/48.customQABot-all-features
    ```

- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Run the sample
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
  1) Launch Bot Framework Emulator
  2) File -> Open Bot
  3) Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

## Try Active Learning
- Try the following utterances:
  1. Surface Book
  2. Power
- In Language Studio, select `inspect` to view the scores of the returned answers and compare how close they are.
- In [Bot Framework Emulator][BFE], a card is generated with the suggestions.
  - Clicking an option sends a [feedback record](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/questionanswering/question-answering-projects/add-feedback), which shows as suggestion under `Review suggestions` in [Language Studio][LS].
  - `ACTIVE_LEARNING_CARD_TITLE`, `ACTIVE_LEARNING_CARD_NO_MATCH_TEXT` and `ACTIVE_LEARNING_CARD_NO_MATCH_RESPONSE` in the card can be changed from [rootDialog.js](dialogs/rootDialog.js).

## Try Multi-turn prompt
- Try the following utterances:
  1. Accessibility
  2. Options
- You'll notice that multi-turn prompts associated with the question are also returned in the responses.

## Try Precise Answering
- Try the following utterances:
  1) Accessibility
  2) Register
- You will notice a short answer returned along with a long answer.
- If testing in [Language Studio][LS], you might have to check `Include short answer response` at the top.
- You can disable precise answering by setting `EnablePreciseAnswer` to false in [.env file](.env).
- You can set `DisplayPreciseAnswerOnly` to true in [.env file](.env) to display just precise answers in the response.
- Learn more about [precise answering][PA].

## Query unstructured content
- Go to your project in [Language Studio][LS]. In `Manage sources`, select `+ Add source`.
- Select `URLs` and add `https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2022/01/27/from-empowering-frontline-workers-to-accessibility-improvements-heres-whats-new-in-microsoft-365/`. 
- Select **unstructured** in the `Classify file structure` dropdown.
- Try the following utterances:
  1. Frontline workers
  2. Hybrid work solutions
- Make sure answers are returned with a high score.
- To prevent querying unstructured sources, set `INCLUDE_UNSTRUCTURED_SOURCES` to false in [rootDialog.js](dialogs/rootDialog.js).

## Try Filters
If you want to return answers with only specified metadata, use the following steps:
- Go to your project in [Language Studio][LS]. In `Edit knowledge bases`, under the **Metadata** column, select `+ Add`
- Select a QnA to edit and add a key value pair. Add the key value pair `Language` : `Javascript`, then select `Save changes`.
- Select `Test`, then **Show advanced options**, then select the metadata you just added (`Language : Javascript`).
You can also filter answers using a bot by passing it metadata and/or source filters. To do this, edit line 54 in [rootDialog.js](dialogs/rootDialog.js) to something like the code snippet below. For more information, see [Query filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/questionanswering/question-answering/get-answers#queryfilters).
    ```js
    //Add below lines in line no. 54 in rootDialog.js
    var filters = {
        metadataFilter: {
            metadata: [
                { key: 'Language', value: 'Javascript' },
            ],
            logicalOperation: 'OR'
        },
        sourceFilter: [],
        logicalOperation: 'AND'
    };

    qnaMakerDialog.filters = filters;
    ```    

## Configure Adaptive Cards for Microsoft Teams
When using the Microsoft Teams channel, you have the option of using Adaptive Cards instead of Hero Cards for CQA responses. To enable these cards, perform the following steps:

1. Update the `botbuilder-ai` package to version `4.21.0` or greater.
2. Set the `UseTeamsAdaptiveCard` variable in the `.env` file to `true`.

If you do not set the `UseTeamsAdaptiveCard` variable or set it to false, the existing Hero Card implementation will be used.


## Microsoft Teams channel group chat fix
To get answers from the service when a bot (named as `HelpBot`) is added to a Teams channel or Teams group chat, refer to it as `@HelpBot` `How to build a bot?`.
However, the bot may try to send `<at>HelpBot</at>` `How to build a bot?` as a query to the Custom question answering service, which may not give expected results for question to bot. The following code removes `<at>HelpBot</at>` mentions of the bot from the message and sends the remaining text as query to the service.
- Goto `dialogs/rootDialog.js`
- Add the following references:
    ```js
    const {
        TurnContext
    } = require('botbuilder-core');
    ```
- Modify `run` function as
    ```js
    async run(context, accessor) {
        const dialogSet = new DialogSet(accessor);
        dialogSet.add(this);

        const dialogContext = await dialogSet.createContext(context);

        if (context.activity.channelId === "msteams") {
            context.activity.text = TurnContext.removeRecipientMention(context.request);
        }

        const results = await dialogContext.continueDialog();
        if (results.status === DialogTurnStatus.empty) {
            await dialogContext.beginDialog(this.id);
        }
    }
    ```

## Deploy the bot to Azure
See [Deploy your bot to Azure][50] for instructions.

The deployment process assumes you have an account on Microsoft Azure and are able to log into the [Microsoft Azure Portal][Azure].

If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please refer to [Getting started with Azure][70] for guidance on how to get started on Azure.
