This sample creates an echo bot that also welcomes user when they join the conversation. The welcoming pattern shown in this bot is applicable for personal (1:1) conversation with bots. 

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, 
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/03.welcome-users
    ```
- [Optional] Update the .env file under samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions with your botFileSecret
    For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i & npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via
    ```bash
    npm i & npm run watch
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to samples/javascript_nodejs/03.Welcome-Users folder
- Select Welcome-Users.bot file

# ConversationUpdate Activity Type
The [ConversationUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-activity-spec?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#conversation-update-activity) Activity describes a change in conversation members, for example when a new user (and/or) a bot joins the conversation. The channel sends this activity when a user (and/or) bot joins the conversation. It is recommended that you test your bot behavior on the target channel. 

Bots that are added directly by a user, are mostly personal (1:1) conversation bots. It is a best practice to send a welcome message to introduce the bot tell a bit about its functionality. To do this, ensure that your bot responds to the `ConversationUpdate` message. Use the `membersAdded` field to identify the list of channel participants (bots or users) that were added to the conversation.

Your bot may proactively send a welcome message to a personal chat the first time a user initiates a personal chat with your bot. Use `UserState` to persist a flag indicating first user interaction with a bot.
