# transcript logger sample
Bot Framework v4 transcript logger bot sample

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework][1], it shows how to create a bot that demonstrates storing transcript logs of the conversation. The file `customLogger.js` contains a custom implementation of the logging middleware.

This implementation contains an object that saves ongoing conversations and writes them to a file after the end state of the conversation has been reached via a value "endOfInput" set on the last message in the `bot.js` file.

In this example, the bot creates a new folder in the project directory called `logs` and the conversations' transcripts are saved as `.log` files after the user has chatted with the bot. The bot also logs the conversation to the terminal as the user chats with it.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 10.14 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/26.transcript-logger`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/26.bot-transcript-logging
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.2.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/26.transcript-logger` folder
- Select `transcript-logger.bot` file

# Bot state
A key to good bot design is to track the context of a conversation, so that your bot remembers things like the answers to previous questions. Depending on what your bot is used for, you may even need to keep track of conversation state or store user related information for longer than the lifetime of one given conversation.

In this example, the bot's state is used to track number of messages.

 A bot's state is information it remembers in order to respond appropriately to incoming messages. The Bot Builder SDK provides classes for [storing and retrieving state data][4] as an object associated with a user or a conversation.

    - Conversation properties help your bot keep track of the current conversation the bot is having with the user. If your bot needs to complete a sequence of steps or switch between conversation topics, you can use conversation properties to manage steps in a sequence or track the current topic. Since conversation properties reflect the state of the current conversation, you typically clear them at the end of a session, when the bot receives an end of conversation activity.

    - User properties can be used for many purposes, such as determining where the user's prior conversation left off or simply greeting a returning user by name. If you store a user's preferences, you can use that information to customize the conversation the next time you chat. For example, you might alert the user to a news article about a topic that interests her, or alert a user when an appointment becomes available. You should clear them if the bot receives a delete user data activity.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Prerequisites
- [Azure Deployment Prerequisites][41]

## Provision a Bot with Azure Bot Service
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

```bash
# set you Azure subscription
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

```bash
# provision Azure Bot Services resources to host your bot
msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your bot running locally, and want to deploy those change to Azure Bot Service, you can _publish_ those change using either `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.
