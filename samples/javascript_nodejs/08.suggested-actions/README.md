Bot Framework v4 suggested actions bot sample

This sample shows how to use suggested actions.  Suggested actions enable your bot to present buttons that the user can tap to provide input.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 8.5 or higher

```bash
# determine node version
node --version
```

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator/releases)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions` folder
- Select `suggested-actions.bot` file

# Suggested Actions
Suggested actions enable your bot to present buttons that the user can tap to provide input. Suggested actions appear close to the composer and enhance user experience.
They enable the user to answer a question or make a selection with a simple tap of a button, rather than having to type a response with a keyboard.

Unlike buttons that appear within rich cards (which remain visible and accessible to the user even after being tapped), buttons that appear within the suggested actions pane will disappear after the user makes a selection. This prevents the user from tapping stale buttons within a conversation and simplifies bot development (since you will not need to account for that scenario).

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id> --appId <YOUR APP ID> --appSecret <YOUR APP SECRET PASSWORD>
```

**NOTE**: You can obtain your `appId` and `appSecret` at the Microsoft's [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/)
