// For example:
// "Monday" could be any Monday ever.
// "May 5th" could be any one of the possible May 5th in the past or the future.
// TIMEX does not represent ambiguous times. So if the natural language mentioned 4 o'clock
// it could be either 4AM or 4PM. For that the recognizer (and by extension LUIS) would return two TIMEX expressions.
