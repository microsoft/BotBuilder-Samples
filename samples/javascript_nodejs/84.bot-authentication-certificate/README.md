# Authentication Bot using SSL/TLS certificates

Bot Framework v4 bot authentication using Certificate

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), is shows how to use the bot authentication capabilities of Azure Bot Service. In this sample, we use a local or KeyVault certificate to create the Bot Framework Authentication.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18 or higher

```bash
# determine node version
node --version
```

## To try this sample

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
```

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/84.bot-authentication-certificate`

```bash
cd samples/javascript_nodejs/84.bot-authentication-certificate
```

- Install modules

```bash
npm install
```

- Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the latest Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

## Interacting with the bot

This sample uses the bot authentication capabilities of Azure Bot Service, providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users using digital security certificates. You just need to provide the certificate data linked to the managed identity and run the bot, then communicate with it to validate its correct authentication.

## SSL/TLS certificate

An SSL/TLS certificate is a digital object that allows systems to verify identity and subsequently establish an encrypted network connection with another system using the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. Certificates are issued using a cryptographic system known as public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI allows one party to establish the identity of another through the use of certificates if they both trust a third party, known as a certificate authority. SSL/TLS certificates therefore function as digital identity documents that protect network communications and establish the identity of websites on the Internet as well as resources on private networks.

## Deploy the bot to Azure

To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://aka.ms/azuredeployment) for a complete list of deployment instructions.
