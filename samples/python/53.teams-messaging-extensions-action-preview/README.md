# Teams Messaging Extensions Action Preview

[Messaging Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions) are a special kind of Microsoft Teams application that is support by the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) v4.

There are two basic types of Messaging Extension in Teams: [Search-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command) and [Action-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command). This sample illustrates how to
build an Action Based Messaging Extension and demonstrates creating a simple card based on parameters entered by the user from a Task Module.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [Python SDK](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.7
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

1) Create [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ you can use this [Bot Framework registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework)

1) Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-samples\samples\python\53.teams-messaging-extensions-action-preview` folder

1) Activate your desired virtual environment

1) Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the project folder.

1) Update the `config.py` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

1) Run your bot with `python app.py`

## Interacting with the bot in Teams

> Note the `manifest.json` specifies that this bot will be available in the `team` scope and the command will be available in the `compose`, `commandBox` and `message` contexts.

Click the Messaging Extension icon in the Compose Box's Messaging Extension menu.

## Deploy the bot to Azure

To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://aka.ms/azuredeployment) for a complete list of deployment instructions.
