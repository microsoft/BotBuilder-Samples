## Interacting with the bot

Most channels support rich content.  In this sample we explore the different types of rich cards your bot may use.  A key to good bot design is to send interactive media, such as Rich Cards. There are several different types of Rich Cards, which are as follows:

- Animation Card
- Audio Card
- Hero Card
- Receipt Card
- Sign In Card
- Thumbnail Card
- Video Card

When [designing the user experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-user-experience?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#cards) developers should consider adding visual elements such as Rich Cards.
