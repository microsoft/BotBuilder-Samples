## Welcoming Users

The primary goal when creating any bot is to engage your user in a meaningful conversation. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to ensure that from the moment a user first connects, they understand your bot’s main purpose and capabilities, the reason your bot was created. See [Send welcome message to users](https://aka.ms/botframework-welcome-instructions) for additional information on how a bot can welcome users to a conversation.
