# Bot Authentication

Bot Framework v4 bot authentication sample

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to use authentication in your bot using OAuth.

The sample uses the bot authentication capabilities in [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.botframework.com), providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users to various identity providers such as Azure AD (Azure Active Directory), GitHub, Uber, etc.

NOTE: Microsoft Teams currently differs slightly in the way auth is integrated with the bot. Refer to sample 46.teams-auth.

## Running the sample
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
```
- Activate your desired virtual environment
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-samples\samples\python\18.bot-authentication` folder
- In the terminal, type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Deploy your bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://aka.ms/azuredeployment)
- [Add Authentication to your bot via Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp)
- Modify `APP_ID`, `APP_PASSWORD`, and `CONNECTION_NAME` in `config.py`

After Authentication has been configured via Azure Bot Service, you can test the bot.

- In the terminal, type `python app.py`

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.3.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`
- Enter the app id and password

## Authentication

This sample uses bot authentication capabilities in Azure Bot Service, providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users to various identity providers such as Azure AD (Azure Active Directory), GitHub, Uber, etc. These updates also take steps towards an improved user experience by eliminating the magic code verification for some clients.

## Deploy the bot to Azure

To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://aka.ms/azuredeployment) for a complete list of deployment instructions.
