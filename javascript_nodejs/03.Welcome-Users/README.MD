[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

This sample creates an echo bot that also welcomes user when they join the conversation. The welcoming pattern shown in this bot is applicable for personal (1:1) conversation with bots. 

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to javascript_nodejs\samples\03.Welcome-Users
    ```bash
    cd javascript_nodejs\samples\03.Welcome-Users
    ```
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i & npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via
    ```bash
    npm i & npm run watch
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to samples\3.Welcome-Users folder
- Select Welcome-Users.bot file

# ConversationUpdate Activity Type
The [ConversationUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-activity-spec?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#conversation-update-activity) an Activity type describes a change in conversation members, for example when a new user (and/or) a bot joins the conversation. The channel sends this activity when a user (and/or) bot joins the conversation. It is recomended that you test your bot behaivor on the target channel. 

Bots that are added directly by a user, are mostly personal (1:1) conversation bots. It is a best practice to send a welcome message to introduce the bot tell a bit about its functionality. To do this, ensure that your bot responds to the `ConversationUpdate` message. Use the `membersAdded` field to identify the list of channel participants (bots or users) that were added to the conversation.

Your bot may proactively send a welcome message to a personal chat the first time a user initiates a personal chat with your bot. Use `UserState` to persist a flag indicating first user interaction with a bot. 

# User state
A key to good bot design is to track the context of a conversation, so that your bot remembers things like the answers to previous questions. Depending on what your bot is used for, you may even need to keep track of conversation state or store user related information for longer than the lifetime of one given conversation.

In this example, we use 'UserState' to identify if the user communicated with the bot before. .

 A bot's state is information it remembers in order to respond appropriately to incoming messages. The Bot Builder SDK provides classes for [storing and retrieving state data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=js) as an object associated with a user or a conversation.

    - User properties can be used for many purposes, such as determining where the user's prior conversation left off or simply greeting a returning user by name. If you store a user's preferences, you can use that information to customize the conversation the next time you chat. For example, you might alert the user to a news article about a topic that interests her, or alert a user when an appointment becomes available. You should clear them if the bot receives a delete user data activity.
    
    - Conversation properties help your bot keep track of the current conversation the bot is having with the user. If your bot needs to complete a sequence of steps or switch between conversation topics, you can use conversation properties to manage steps in a sequence or track the current topic. Since conversation properties reflect the state of the current conversation, you typically clear them at the end of a session, when the bot receives an end of conversation activity.
