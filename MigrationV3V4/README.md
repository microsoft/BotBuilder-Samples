# Bot Framework Migration from V3 to V4


## Overview

This branch contains samples for migration workflows from **Bot Framework V3 SDK** to  **Microsoft Bot Framework V4 SDK** for [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet) and [JS](https://github.com//microsoft/botbuilder-js). 

## Goals of this work

In some cases, since the V4 SDK contains substantial improvements that are not compatible with V3, some migration may require potential re-write or substantial effort. This section contains examples and best practices to support [Migration][1] documentation.

## Samples
